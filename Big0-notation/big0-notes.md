Big 0 Notation notes - Udemy

- Way of determining which code is the "best".
- May have some trade offs, slower up front, but earsier to scale. Faster to download, but requires more storage, etc.

Timing Our Code - Udemy

- When given 2 different pieces of code, which is better? What does better mean? Faster, Less memory, more readable.
- Can write code to time both functions, but different machines run at differetn times, so results will vary. Even on the same machine, the time can vary.

Counting our operations -

- Counting our operations is a way to stay consistent, as the computer will always perform those operations, ragardless of speed.
- An operation is something the computer performs, like adding, subtractig, multiplying, etc. Each operations adds 1 to the stack.
- In loop, the add function will perform once for each iteration (n times). As 'n' grows, so does the computational power needed and time/space.
- Can use a performance tracker to track time as well. Will show the time difference between the 2 algortihms on a graph. 'N' grows exponetionally as the number gets bigger.

What is Big 0? A way for us to talk the runtime fo an algorithm growth as inputs grow. Don't care about the details, looking at trends. It looks at worst case senario.
