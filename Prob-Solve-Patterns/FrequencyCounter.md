# Frequency Counter Pattern

Uses objects or sets to collect values/ frquencies of values. Can often avoid need for nested loops or operations with arrays/strings.

Looks for not only similar varialbes, but also how often they appear. So if 2 shows up twice, even if it 2 is in there, it must appear two times in this algorythm.
